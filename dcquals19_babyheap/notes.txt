Make:
	allocate 0xf8 chunk,  allow to fill in `input_size` bytes. when delete content, only delete 'input_size' bytes. 

	Array of heap pointers start at 0x0000555555558060
	Each heap pointer lies 0x10 from each other, so does size. 
	x/100gx 0x000055555555a560

Show:
	can leak address of the next free chunk by entering '\n' or '\0' as the content: when we reallocate a free chunk from tcache, the just-allocated chunk still contain the pointer to the next-to-be-reallocated chunk.
